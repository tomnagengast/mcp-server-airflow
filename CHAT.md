# Development Transcript


> I've built two mcp servers, one for salesforce (https://github.com/tomnagengast/mcp-server-salesforce) and one for hex (https://github.com/tomnagengast/mcp-server-hex), now want to build
  one for airflow. Reference the current mcp docs (https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk), airflow api docs
  (https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/stable-rest-api-ref.html) and build and mcp server that I can run with npx from Claude Desktop then create a new github repo. Remember
   to commit often so that you can understand what's happened so far and roll back to any points that you might need to.
